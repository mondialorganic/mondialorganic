		Dried fig leaves, often overshadowed by the more popular and well-known dried fig fruits they produce, also have their own set of unique qualities and uses. These leaves come from the fig tree, scientifically known as Ficus carica, a member of the mulberry family. Fig trees are native to the Mediterranean region but are now grown in many parts of the world.
While fig fruits are prized for their sweet and succulent flavor, fig leaves have found their own niche in culinary and medicinal applications.

		Stevia leaves, scientifically known as Stevia rebaudiana, are the source of one of the most popular natural sweeteners in the world. Native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil, these small, green, and herbaceous leaves have been used for centuries by indigenous communities for their sweetening properties and medicinal benefits.
